# FundX — Autonomous AI Fund Manager

> **CLI-first, goal-oriented, multi-fund autonomous investment platform powered by Claude Code.**

FundX lets you define investment funds with **real-life financial objectives** and delegates analysis, decision-making, and trade execution to Claude Code running autonomously via scheduled sessions.

## What Makes FundX Different

- **Goal-oriented, not return-oriented.** You say "I have $30k, I spend $2k/month, give me 18 months of runway" — not "beat the S&P."
- **Claude Code as artisan.** Each session, Claude invents analysis tools, writes scripts, searches the web, and makes decisions — not limited to pre-defined pipelines.
- **Multi-fund architecture.** Run a conservative runway fund, an aggressive growth fund, and a BTC accumulation fund simultaneously, each with its own AI personality.
- **Bidirectional Telegram.** Get trade alerts AND wake Claude anytime to ask questions about positions or past analyses.
- **Paper first, live later.** Every fund starts in paper mode. Live trading requires explicit confirmation and safety checks.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20
- **Claude Code** CLI installed and configured
- **pnpm** (recommended) or npm
- **Alpaca** account for paper/live trading (optional for setup)
- **Telegram** bot token for notifications (optional)

## Installation

```bash
# From npm (when published)
npm install -g fundx

# From source

```

## Fund Objective Types

## Architecture

```
CLI (fundx) --> Daemon/Scheduler --> Claude Code Session --> MCP Servers
                     |                      |
               Telegram Gateway      Persistent State (per fund)
```

Each Claude Code session:
1. Reads the fund's `CLAUDE.md` (its constitution) and `fund_config.yaml`
2. Reads persistent state (portfolio, journal, past analyses)
3. Creates and executes analysis scripts as needed
4. Optionally launches sub-agents in parallel (macro, technical, sentiment, risk)
5. Makes decisions within fund constraints
6. Executes trades via MCP broker server
7. Updates state and generates reports
8. Sends notifications via Telegram

### Workspace Structure

```

### MCP Servers

| Server | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `broker-alpaca` | Trade execution, positions, account info |
| `market-data` | Price data, OHLCV bars, quotes (Yahoo Finance) |
| `telegram-notify` | Send notifications to Telegram |

### Multi-Broker Support

FundX supports multiple brokers via a unified adapter:

| Broker | Asset Types | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Alpaca | Stocks, ETFs | Implemented |
| Interactive Brokers | International markets | Adapter ready |
| Binance | Crypto | Adapter ready |

## Configuration

### Global Config (`~/.fundx/config.yaml`)

Created by `fundx init`. Stores broker credentials, Telegram token, Claude Code path, and default settings. Credentials are **never** stored in per-fund configs.

### Fund Config (`fund_config.yaml`)

Each fund is fully defined by its config. Key sections:

- **fund** — Name, description, status
- **capital** — Initial capital, currency
- **objective** — Goal type and parameters
- **risk** — Profile, max drawdown, stop-loss, position limits, custom rules
- **universe** — Allowed/forbidden asset types and tickers
- **schedule** — Trading sessions with times and focus areas
- **broker** — Provider and mode (paper/live)
- **notifications** — Telegram alerts, quiet hours, priority overrides
- **claude** — Model, personality, decision framework

See the [full schema example](https://github.com/machester4/fundx#fund-configuration-schema) in the design document.

## Telegram Integration

### Quick Commands (instant, no Claude needed)

```
/status [fund]    — Fund status summary
/portfolio fund   — Current holdings
/trades fund      — Recent trades
/pause fund       — Pause a fund
/resume fund      — Resume a fund
/next             — Next scheduled sessions
```

### Free Questions (wakes Claude)

Any non-command message wakes Claude Code with full fund context:

```
You: "why did you sell GDXJ yesterday?"
Bot: [Claude explains with references to its analysis archive]

You: "which fund has the most risk this week?"
Bot: [Cross-fund analysis comparing all active funds]
```

### Notifications

Trade alerts, stop-loss triggers, daily/weekly digests, milestone alerts, and runway warnings — with quiet hours and priority overrides.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install              # Install dependencies
pnpm dev -- --help        # Run CLI in dev mode (tsx)
pnpm build                # Build for production (tsup)
pnpm start -- --help      # Run production build
pnpm test                 # Run tests (vitest)
pnpm lint                 # Lint (eslint)
pnpm format               # Format (prettier)
pnpm typecheck            # Type check (tsc --noEmit)
```

## Design Principles

1. **Goal-first, not trade-first.** Every decision is evaluated against the fund's life objective.
2. **Claude as artisan.** No pre-defined pipeline — Claude creates scripts, research, and calculations as needed.
3. **Declarative funds.** A fund is fully defined by `fund_config.yaml`. Everything else is derived.
4. **State is king.** Everything persists between sessions. Claude always knows where it left off.
5. **Human in the loop, not in the way.** Autonomous operation with CLI/Telegram intervention available.
6. **Paper first, live later.** Every fund starts in paper mode.
7. **Memory makes it smarter.** Trade journal + FTS5 search enables learning from history.
8. **Open and extensible.** New brokers, MCP servers, and objective types are all pluggable.
