# CLAUDE.md — FundX Development Guide

## Project Overview

FundX is a **CLI-first, goal-oriented, multi-fund autonomous investment platform** powered by Claude Code. It lets users define investment funds with real-life financial objectives (e.g., "sustain 18 months of living expenses") and delegates analysis, decision-making, and trade execution to Claude Code running autonomously via scheduled sessions.

**Current status:** Phases 1-5 complete. All core features implemented. Ready for Phase 6 (Community & Polish).

**License:** Apache 2.0

## Architecture

### Core Concepts

- **Fund**: An independent investment entity with its own capital, objective, risk profile, asset universe, schedule, and persistent memory. Each fund lives in `~/.fundx/funds/<name>/`.
- **Session**: A Claude Code invocation scoped to a single fund. Sessions run on a schedule (pre-market, mid-session, post-market) or on-demand via CLI/Telegram.
- **Daemon/Scheduler**: Background process that checks schedules and launches Claude Code sessions for each active fund.
- **Telegram Gateway**: Always-on bot for notifications (trade alerts, digests) and bidirectional interaction (user questions wake Claude).
- **MCP Servers**: Broker integrations (Alpaca, IBKR, Binance), market data, news/sentiment, and Telegram notifications.

### High-Level Flow

```
CLI (fundx) → Daemon/Scheduler → Claude Code Session → MCP Servers (broker, data, telegram)
                                       ↕
                                 Persistent State (per fund)
```

Each Claude Code session:
1. Reads the fund's `CLAUDE.md` (its constitution) and `fund_config.yaml`
2. Reads persistent state (portfolio, journal, past analyses)
3. Creates and executes analysis scripts as needed
4. Optionally launches sub-agents for parallel analysis
5. Makes decisions within fund constraints
6. Executes trades via MCP broker server
7. Updates persistent state and generates reports
8. Sends notifications via Telegram

## Development Conventions

### Code Style

- TypeScript with strict mode enabled (`"strict": true` in tsconfig.json)
- Use ESM modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- Format with Prettier, lint with ESLint (flat config)
- Prefer Zod schemas for runtime validation of configs and API responses
- Use `node:path` and `node:fs/promises` (node: protocol prefix)
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes; use `type` for unions and intersections
- Use `async/await` throughout — no raw Promise chains or callbacks

### Source Structure

```

```

**Design pattern:** Each file owns its domain completely — CLI command definition and business logic live together. No separate "commands" and "core" layers. This avoids indirection while the codebase is small. Split only when a file gets too large.

- All Zod schemas and types live in `types.ts` — single import for any module
- `paths.ts` is the only place that knows about `~/.fundx` structure
- `state.ts` handles all JSON read/write with atomic writes (tmp + rename)
- New commands get their own file (e.g., `ask.ts`, `portfolio.ts`) and register in `index.ts`

### Configuration

- Global config: `~/.fundx/config.yaml` (broker credentials, Telegram token, Claude path)
- Per-fund config: `~/.fundx/funds/<name>/fund_config.yaml` (objective, risk, universe, schedule, AI personality)
- Credentials must NEVER be stored in per-fund configs or committed to git
- The `.gitignore` already covers `.env` files — maintain this pattern

### Key Design Principles

1. **Goal-first, not trade-first** — Every decision is evaluated against the fund's life objective, not just P&L
2. **Claude as artisan** — No pre-defined analysis pipeline; Claude creates scripts, research, and calculations as needed each session
3. **Declarative funds** — A fund is fully defined by its `fund_config.yaml`; everything else is derived
4. **State is king** — Everything persists between sessions; Claude always knows where it left off
5. **Human in the loop, not in the way** — Autonomous operation with CLI/Telegram intervention available
6. **Paper first, live later** — Every fund starts in paper mode; live trading requires explicit confirmation
7. **Memory makes it smarter** — Trade journal + vector search enables learning from history
8. **Open and extensible** — New brokers, MCP servers, and objective types are all pluggable

### Fund Objective Types

When implementing fund logic, support these objective types:

| Type          | Optimization Target                    |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| `runway`     | Sustain monthly expenses for N months  |
| `growth`     | Multiply capital by target multiple    |
| `accumulation`| Acquire target amount of an asset     |
| `income`     | Generate passive monthly income        |
| `custom`     | Free-form user-defined objective       |

### State Files (per fund)

- `portfolio.json` — Current holdings, cash, market values
- `objective_tracker.json` — Progress toward fund goal
- `trade_journal.sqlite` — All trades with reasoning, outcomes, embeddings
- `session_log.json` — Last session metadata

## Build & Run Commands

```bash
pnpm install              # Install dependencies
pnpm dev -- --help        # Run CLI in dev mode (tsx)
pnpm build                # Build for production (tsup)
pnpm start -- --help      # Run production build
pnpm test                 # Run tests (vitest)
pnpm lint                 # Lint (eslint)
pnpm format               # Format (prettier)
pnpm typecheck            # Type check (tsc --noEmit)
```

## Testing Conventions

- **Vitest** as test framework — test files in `tests/` (e.g., `tests/fund.test.ts`)
- Use `vi.mock()` for module mocking, `vi.spyOn()` for partial mocking
- Mock `fs` operations and external APIs — never hit real broker/market APIs in tests
- CLI integration tests should test command handler functions directly

## Important Notes for AI Assistants

- The README.md is the authoritative design document — refer to it for detailed schemas, CLI flow examples, and architecture diagrams
- When creating new files, follow the planned directory structure above
- Never hardcode broker credentials or API keys; always read from global config
- Fund state files must always be updated atomically (write to temp file, then rename)
- Every trade must be logged in the SQLite journal with reasoning
- Per-fund `CLAUDE.md` files are auto-generated from `fund_config.yaml` — they are separate from this root `CLAUDE.md`
- The `.gitignore` already covers Node.js patterns (node_modules, dist, etc.) — extend it with `*.tsbuildinfo` if not already present
